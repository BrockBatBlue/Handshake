# Handshake - a Service App (project_2)
This application uses google geolocation to help local service providers (i.e. tree trimmers, carpenters, plumbers, etc.) connect to their clientele in a more efficient manner.

## Local Service providers can
* post his/her service on the site for local clientele.
* maintain a high level of word-of-mouth through reviews given.

## Clientele can
* browse through local services in their area
* search for a specific service in their area
* send reviews after receiving a service from a selected provider

Project made with ❤ by the handshake team Alan, Emily, and Rodrigo
